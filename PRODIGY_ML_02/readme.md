## Introduction

[Provide a detailed introduction to the project, including its purpose, scope, and any relevant background information.]

For example:

This notebook demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for classifying images of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

## Setup

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    \`\`\`

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    \`\`\`bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    \`\`\`

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    \`\`\`bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \`\`\`

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

    \`\`\`bash
    jupyter notebook
    \`\`\`

5. **Open the notebook:**

    In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to `ML_TASK_02.ipynb` and open it.

## Usage

[Provide a guide on how to use the notebook, including any specific instructions or parameters that need to be set before running the cells.]

For example:

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Ensure that the dataset is properly placed in the specified directory.
    - Run the data preprocessing cells to load and prepare the data.

2. **Model Training:**
    - Adjust any hyperparameters or model settings as needed.
    - Run the model training cells to train the model.

3. **Evaluation:**
    - Execute the evaluation cells to assess the model's performance.
    - Use the provided visualization tools to analyze the results.
