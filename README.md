# PRODIGY_INFOTECH_INTERN

This repository contains various machine learning projects implemented during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. Each project showcases different aspects of machine learning techniques, from regression and clustering to classification and gesture recognition. Below is a detailed description of each task.

## Task 1: Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

### Description
This project involves implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The goal is to create a simple yet effective model to understand the relationship between these features and the price of the house.

### Files
- `linear_regression.py`: Contains the implementation of the linear regression model.
- `house_prices.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: Detailed description and instructions for running the model.

### Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, normalization, etc.).
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the linear regression model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

## Task 2: K-means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

### Description
This project involves creating a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to enable targeted marketing strategies.

### Files
- `k_means_clustering.py`: Contains the implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm.
- `customer_data.csv`: The dataset used for clustering.
- `README.md`: Detailed description and instructions for running the clustering algorithm.

### Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (normalization, feature selection, etc.).
3. Apply the K-means algorithm to segment customers.
4. Visualize the clusters and interpret the results.

## Task 3: SVM for Cat and Dog Image Classification

### Description
This project involves implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used is from Kaggle, containing thousands of labeled images.

### Files
- `svm_image_classification.py`: Contains the implementation of the SVM for image classification.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the cat and dog images.
- `README.md`: Detailed description and instructions for running the SVM model.

### Usage
1. Load and preprocess the image dataset.
2. Extract features from the images using techniques such as HOG or CNNs.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the SVM model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition Model

### Description
This project involves developing a hand gesture recognition model to identify and classify different hand gestures from images or video data. This model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

### Files
- `hand_gesture_recognition.py`: Contains the implementation of the hand gesture recognition model.
- `gesture_dataset/`: Directory containing hand gesture images or video frames.
- `README.md`: Detailed description and instructions for running the gesture recognition model.

### Usage
1. Load and preprocess the gesture dataset.
2. Extract features from the images or video frames.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the recognition model (e.g., using CNNs).
5. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
