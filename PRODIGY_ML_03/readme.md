# ML_TASK_03: Cats vs Dogs Classification

This Jupyter notebook, `ML_TASK_03.ipynb`, contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying images of cats and dogs. The notebook demonstrates the following key steps in the machine learning workflow:

1. **Loading and Visualizing Data**: Importing image data and visualizing examples.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the images for input into a machine learning model.
3. **Model Training**: Building and training a model to classify images.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model on test data.

## Contents

1. **Setup and Libraries**: Importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and image processing tools.
2. **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset of cat and dog images.
3. **Data Visualization**: Displaying sample images to understand the dataset.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and preparing the data for training.
5. **Model Building**: Creating a machine learning model (e.g., using a neural network).
6. **Model Training**: Training the model on the dataset.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on a test set.
